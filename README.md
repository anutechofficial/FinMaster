## Installation

To install `FinMaster`, use npm:

```bash
npm install finmaster
```

---

## Usage

### CommonJS (Node.js)

First, install `FinMaster` from npm:

```bash
npm install finmaster
```

Then, import `FinMaster` into your project:

```javascript
const FinMaster = require('finmaster');
const finMaster = new FinMaster();

let pv = finMaster.calculatePV(0.05, 10, 1000);
console.log('Present Value:', pv);
```

### ES6 Modules

If you are using ES6 modules (recommended for newer Node.js projects or with TypeScript):

```bash
npm install finmaster
```

Import `FinMaster` into your project:

```javascript
import FinMaster from 'finmaster';

const finMaster = new FinMaster();

let pv = finMaster.calculatePV(0.05, 10, 1000);
console.log('Present Value:', pv);
```

### TypeScript

For TypeScript users, ensure you have typings installed:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/finmaster
```

Then, import and use `FinMaster`:

```typescript
import { FinMaster } from 'finmaster';

const finMaster = new FinMaster();

let pv = finMaster.calculatePV(0.05, 10, 1000);
console.log('Present Value:', pv);
```

### Functions

#### PV (Present Value)

Calculates the present value of an investment.

```javascript
const pv = finMaster.calculatePV(rate, nper, pmt, fv, type);
```

- `rate`: The interest rate per period.
- `nper`: The number of periods.
- `pmt`: The payment made each period.
- `fv`: The future value.
- `type`: 0 (end of period) or 1 (beginning of period).

#### FV (Future Value)

Calculates the future value of an investment.

```javascript
const fv = finMaster.calculateFV(rate, nper, pmt, pv, type);
```

- `rate`: The interest rate per period.
- `nper`: The number of periods.
- `pmt`: The payment made each period.
- `pv`: The present value.
- `type`: 0 (end of period) or 1 (beginning of period).

#### PMT (Payment)

Calculates the payment for a loan based on constant payments and a constant interest rate.

```javascript
const pmt = finMaster.calculatePMT(rate, nper, pv, fv, type);
```

- `rate`: The interest rate per period.
- `nper`: The number of periods.
- `pv`: The present value.
- `fv`: The future value.
- `type`: 0 (end of period) or 1 (beginning of period).

#### IPMT (Interest Payment)

Calculates the interest payment for a given period for an investment based on periodic, constant payments and a constant interest rate.

```javascript
const ipmt = finMaster.calculateIPMT(rate, per, nper, pv, fv, type);
```

- `rate`: The interest rate per period.
- `per`: The period for which the interest is calculated.
- `nper`: The number of periods.
- `pv`: The present value.
- `fv`: The future value.
- `type`: 0 (end of period) or 1 (beginning of period).

#### NPV (Net Present Value)

Calculates the net present value of a series of cash flows at a given discount rate.

```javascript
const npv = finMaster.calculateNPV(rate, ...cashFlows);
```

- `rate`: The discount rate.
- `...cashFlows`: The series of cash flows.

#### IRR (Internal Rate of Return)

Calculates the internal rate of return for a series of cash flows.

```javascript
const irr = finMaster.calculateIRR(...cashFlows);
```

- `...cashFlows`: The series of cash flows.

#### RATE

Calculates the interest rate per period of an annuity.

```javascript
const rate = finMaster.calculateRATE(nper, pmt, pv, fv, type, guess);
```

- `nper`: The number of periods.
- `pmt`: The payment made each period.
- `pv`: The present value.
- `fv`: The future value.
- `type`: 0 (end of period) or 1 (beginning of period).
- `guess`: Your guess for what the rate will be.

## Examples

### Example Usage

```javascript
const FinMaster = require("finmaster");

const finMaster = new FinMaster();

// Calculate Present Value
const pv = finMaster.calculatePV(0.05 / 12, 12 * 10, -100, 1000, 0);
console.log(`Present Value: ${pv}`);

// Calculate Future Value
const fv = finMaster.calculateFV(0.05 / 12, 12 * 10, -100, 0, 0);
console.log(`Future Value: ${fv}`);

// Calculate Payment
const pmt = finMaster.calculatePMT(0.05 / 12, 12 * 10, 1000, 0, 0);
console.log(`Payment: ${pmt}`);

// Calculate Interest Payment
const ipmt = finMaster.calculateIPMT(0.05 / 12, 1, 12 * 10, 1000, 0, 0);
console.log(`Interest Payment: ${ipmt}`);

// Calculate Net Present Value
const npv = finMaster.calculateNPV(0.05, -100, 30, 40, 50, 60);
console.log(`Net Present Value: ${npv}`);

// Calculate Internal Rate of Return
const irr = finMaster.calculateIRR(-100, 30, 40, 50, 60);
console.log(`Internal Rate of Return: ${irr}`);

// Calculate Rate
const rate = finMaster.calculateRATE(12 * 10, -100, 1000, 0, 0);
console.log(`Rate: ${rate}`);
```

## Advance Functions

### Get Remaining Loan Term's

The `getRemainingLoanTerm` function calculates the remaining term of a loan given its start date, term length, and term unit. This is useful for determining how much time is left before a loan is fully paid off.

#### Function Signature

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the remaining loan term in months.
 * @param startDateStr - The start date of the loan in the format "MM YYYY", "MMM YYYY".
 * @param loanTerm - The length of the loan term (either in years or months).
 * @param loanTermUnit - The unit of the loan term ("Years" or "Months").
 * @returns The remaining loan term in months, or 0 if the loan is already paid off.
 * @throws Will throw an error if the loan term unit is invalid.
 */
declare function getRemainingLoanTerm(
  startDateStr: string,
  loanTerm: number,
  loanTermUnit: "Years" | "Months"
): number;
```

#### Parameters

- `startDateStr` (string): The start date of the loan in the format "MM YYYY" ("06 2020"), "MMM YYYY" ("Jun 2020).
- `loanTerm` (number): The length of the loan term (either in years or months).
- `loanTermUnit` ("Years" | "Months"): The unit of the loan term ("Years" or "Months").

#### Returns

- `number`: The remaining loan term in months, or 0 if the loan is already paid off.

#### Throws

- Will throw an error if the loan term unit is invalid.

#### Example

Here is an example of how to use the `getRemainingLoanTerm` function:

```javascript
// Assuming the function is imported or available in your project
const remainingTerm = finMaster.getRemainingLoanTerm("06 2020", 5, "Years");
console.log(`Remaining loan term: ${remainingTerm} months`);
```

This function is especially useful for financial applications where users need to track the duration of their loans and understand how much time remains before they are paid off.
