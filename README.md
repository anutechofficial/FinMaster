## Functions

### PV (Present Value)

The PV (Present Value) function is used to calculate the present value of an investment or loan based on a series of future payments. This is particularly useful in financial analysis to determine how much a series of future payments is worth in today's terms, given a specific interest rate.

```javascript
const pv = finMaster.PV(rate, nper, pmt, fv, type);
```

- **rate**: The interest rate for each period.
- **nper**: The number of periods over which the payment will be made.
- **pmt**: The payment made each period; it cannot change over the life of the annuity.
- **fv** (optional): The future value or a cash balance you want to attain after the last payment is made. If omitted, it defaults to 0.
- **type** (optional): The timing of the payment. If omitted, it defaults to 0. Use 0 if payments are due at the end of the period and 1 if payments are due at the beginning of the period.

#### Example Usage

Imagine you want to find out the present value of receiving $1,000 annually for 5 years with an annual interest rate of 5%.

1. **rate**: 5% (0.05)
2. **nper**: 5
3. **pmt**: -$1,000 (outflows are represented as negative values in Javascript financial functions)
4. **fv**: 0 (default, since we are not considering any future value)
5. **type**: 0 (default, since payments are made at the end of each period)

```javascript
const pv = finMaster.PV(0.05, 5, -1000);
```

This function returns approximately -$4329.48, meaning the present value of receiving $1,000 annually for 5 years at a 5% interest rate is about $4329.48 today.

#### Tips for Using PV Function

- **Consistent Periods**: Ensure the interest rate and the number of periods match. For example, if you have a monthly interest rate, the number of periods should also be in months.
- **Cash Flow Sign Convention**: Cash outflows (payments) are usually entered as negative numbers, and cash inflows (receipts) as positive numbers.
- **Future Value (fv)**: This is optional and only used if you are expecting a lump sum in addition to the periodic payments.
- **Type of Payment**: Specify whether payments are made at the beginning or end of the period. Most annuities assume end-of-period payments.

#### Practical Example

Suppose you are considering an investment that pays $500 per month for the next 3 years and the interest rate is 6% annually. You want to find out the present value of this investment.

1. **rate**: 6% annually, which is 0.5% per month (0.06/12)
2. **nper**: 3 years, which is 36 months (3\*12)
3. **pmt**: -$500
4. **fv**: 0
5. **type**: 0

The function in Javascript:

```javascript
const pv = finMaster.PV(0.005, 36, -500);
```

This function will give you the present value of the investment based on the specified parameters.

By understanding and using the PV function, you can make more informed financial decisions by comparing the value of different investments or loans.

### FV (Future Value)

The FV (Future Value) function is used to calculate the future value of an investment based on periodic, constant payments and a constant interest rate. This function helps in determining how much an investment will grow over time.

```javascript
const fv = finMaster.FV(rate, nper, pmt, pv, type);
```

- **rate**: The interest rate for each period.
- **nper**: The total number of payment periods in the investment.
- **pmt**: The payment made each period; it cannot change over the life of the investment.
- **pv** (optional): The present value or initial amount of the investment. If omitted, it defaults to 0.
- **type** (optional): The timing of the payment. If omitted, it defaults to 0. Use 0 if payments are due at the end of the period and 1 if payments are due at the beginning of the period.

#### Example Usage

Imagine you want to find out the future value of saving $200 monthly for 5 years with an annual interest rate of 5%.

1. **rate**: 5% annually (0.05/12 = 0.004167 monthly)
2. **nper**: 5 years (5\*12 = 60 months)
3. **pmt**: -$200 (outflows are represented as negative values in Javascript financial functions)
4. **pv**: 0 (default, since you are starting with zero initial investment)
5. **type**: 0 (default, since payments are made at the end of each period)

The formula in Javascript would look like this:

```javascript
const fv = finMaster.FV(0.004167, 60, -200);
```

This function returns approximately $13,243.44, meaning the future value of saving $200 monthly for 5 years at a 5% annual interest rate is about $13,243.44.

#### Tips for Using FV Function

- **Consistent Periods**: Ensure the interest rate and the number of periods match. For example, if you have a monthly interest rate, the number of periods should also be in months.
- **Cash Flow Sign Convention**: Payments (cash outflows) are usually entered as negative numbers, and cash inflows are entered as positive numbers.
- **Present Value (pv)**: If there is an initial investment, include it; otherwise, it defaults to 0.
- **Type of Payment**: Specify whether payments are made at the beginning or end of the period. Most annuities assume end-of-period payments.

#### Practical Example

Suppose you are planning to save $500 monthly for 10 years in an investment account that offers a 6% annual interest rate compounded monthly. You want to find out how much you will have at the end of the 10 years.

1. **rate**: 6% annually, which is 0.5% per month (0.06/12)
2. **nper**: 10 years, which is 120 months (10\*12)
3. **pmt**: -$500
4. **pv**: 0 (since you are starting with zero initial investment)
5. **type**: 0 (since deposits are made at the end of each period)

The function in Javascript:

```javascript
const fv = finMaster.FV(0.005, 120, -500);
```

This function will give you the future value of the investment based on the specified parameters.

By understanding and using the FV function, you can plan for future financial goals, such as saving for retirement, a down payment on a house, or other long-term objectives.

### PMT (Payment)

The PMT function is used to calculate the payment for a loan based on constant payments and a constant interest rate. This function is helpful in determining the regular payment amount needed to pay off a loan or an investment over a specified period.

```javascript
const pmt = finMaster.PMT(rate, nper, pv, fv, type);
```

- **rate**: The interest rate for each period.
- **nper**: The total number of payment periods in the loan or investment.
- **pv**: The present value, or the total amount that a series of future payments is worth now; the principal of the loan.
- **fv** (optional): The future value or a cash balance you want to attain after the last payment is made. If omitted, it defaults to 0.
- **type** (optional): The timing of the payment. If omitted, it defaults to 0. Use 0 if payments are due at the end of the period and 1 if payments are due at the beginning of the period.

#### Example Usage

Imagine you take out a loan of $10,000 to be paid back over 5 years with an annual interest rate of 6%.

1. **rate**: 6% annually (0.06/12 = 0.005 monthly)
2. **nper**: 5 years (5\*12 = 60 months)
3. **pv**: $10,000
4. **fv**: 0 (default, since we are not considering any future value)
5. **type**: 0 (default, since payments are made at the end of each period)

```javascript
const pmt = finMaster.PMT(0.005, 60, 10000);
```

This function returns approximately -$193.33, meaning the monthly payment to pay off the $10,000 loan over 5 years at a 6% annual interest rate is about $193.33.

#### Tips for Using PMT Function

- **Consistent Periods**: Ensure the interest rate and the number of periods match. For example, if you have a monthly interest rate, the number of periods should also be in months.
- **Cash Flow Sign Convention**: The result of the PMT function will be negative if you are calculating loan payments because it represents an outflow. You can use the ABS function to get a positive result.
- **Future Value (fv)**: This is optional and only used if you are expecting a lump sum at the end of the payment periods.
- **Type of Payment**: Specify whether payments are made at the beginning or end of the period. Most loans assume end-of-period payments.

#### Practical Example

Suppose you are planning to save $15,000 over 3 years in an investment account that offers a 4% annual interest rate compounded monthly. You want to find out how much you need to deposit each month.

1. **rate**: 4% annually, which is 0.333% per month (0.04/12)
2. **nper**: 3 years, which is 36 months (3\*12)
3. **pv**: 0 (since you are starting with zero savings)
4. **fv**: $15,000
5. **type**: 0 (since deposits are made at the end of each period)

The function in Javascript:

```javascript
const pmt = finMaster.PMT(0.00333, 36, 0, 15000);
```

This function will give you the monthly payment amount needed to reach your savings goal based on the specified parameters.

By using the PMT function, you can plan and manage your loan repayments or savings deposits efficiently, ensuring that you meet your financial goals.
